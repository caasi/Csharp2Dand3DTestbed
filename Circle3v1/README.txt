This is a sample application of the 2D testbed, documented further in the "Getting started" guide. 

There are three pink draggable points, through which a circle is drawn. You can drag the points and then click "Redraw Circle" to 
see a circle through the three new points. "Reset" sets the points back to their original positions. 

Version 2 of this app does automatic updating of the circle when the control points are moved.
