This is the 2D testbed library that accompanies Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, 3rd Edition. 
The test program to exercise the library is in the Testbed2DApp project. 

Some classes (especially GImage) differ slightly from their descriptions in the book, new features having been added. 

There's also a GraphPaperAlt class, which has y increasing DOWN rather than UP, which can be nice
for image-manipulation programs. 

The best way to become familiar with the testbed is to load the GraphicsBook.sln solution into Visual Studio
and explore the various applications (Subdiv, Circle3, Dualize, ...) that have been created using it.
