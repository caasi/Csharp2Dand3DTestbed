This is the 3D WPF testbed; it's less of a testbed than the 2D one, but that's because by the time you need to use it, you should be 
getting pretty familier with graphics, so any starter program should get you on your way. 

What's included are some shape generators (for building cubes and sphere) and a program that loads up a 
few shapes and lets you adjust the tesseletion of the sphere via a couple of sliders, and turn on and 
off some texturing. From there, you can do whatever you like.
