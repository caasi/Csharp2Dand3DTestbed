This is a library of linear-algebra classes representing various kinds of transformations -- Matrix transforms that operate on the plane or 3-space, Linear transforms (an abstraction of a matrix transform), Affine transforms (Linear plus translation) and Projective transforms. In each of the last 3 cases, practical constructors are provided, of the form "return to me the affine transformation of the plane that takes THESE three points to THOSE three points, respectively."  The source points (or vectors in some cases) must constitute a frame for the domain; chapter 12 of Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, explains what this means.
